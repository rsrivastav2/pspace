Description:

SmartKubeOps is a user-friendly, web-based utility tool designed to simplify and streamline Kubernetes operations for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Built using Python Flask (backend) and React JS (frontend), this tool empowers users—especially DevOps engineers, developers, and support teams—to perform complex kubectl operations through a clean and intuitive UI without the need to use command-line tools.

Key Features:

🔍 Cluster Selection: Choose from available AKS clusters via a dropdown for scoped operations.

🛠 One-Click Actions:

Kill Pods gracefully or forcefully.

Scale Deployments up or down instantly.

Restart Deployments to reinitialize applications.

Fetch Pod Logs for real-time troubleshooting.

View and Copy Certificates or Secrets securely.

Check Pod Status and health in real-time.

🔐 Secure & Controlled Execution: All operations are securely executed using authenticated service accounts with limited RBAC access.

📜 Audit Logging: Every operation is logged for traceability and governance.

🎯 No CLI Dependency: No need for DevOps to SSH or use kubectl manually—everything is abstracted into click-based actions.

Why It’s Valuable:

Traditional kubectl usage requires CLI expertise, proper configuration, and context switching. This tool reduces human error, boosts productivity, and is perfect for support teams or junior engineers who need operational access without full K8s command-line knowledge. It enhances operational safety and visibility across teams.

Innovation Beyond Standard Tools:

Unlike basic dashboards, SmartKubeOps provides custom actions with targeted scope, real-time feedback, and seamless integration with AKS—all in one place. It can easily be extended to support multi-cloud or multi-cluster setups.
