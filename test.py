In high-pressure production environments, especially while resolving incidents related to Kubernetes (AKS) pods and deployments, engineers often need to:

Manually switch clusters and namespaces

Use kubectl CLI commands repeatedly

Collect pod logs for debugging

Restart deployments or scale pods urgently

Extract certificate data for validation or renewal

These operations are time-sensitive, prone to human error, and not accessible to less experienced team members or support staff.
