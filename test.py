This tool, while initially designed for production support and incident response, can be extended and adapted for:

Dev/Test Environments: Allow developers or QA teams to manage test pods, restart apps, or scale services without needing deep Kubernetes knowledge.

Self-Service Portals: Integrate it into internal developer platforms for teams to self-serve common operations safely and securely.

On-Call Operations: Make it easier for on-call engineers to take action even from mobile/tablet browsers during outages without logging into the CLI.

Non-AKS Clusters: With minor backend changes, it can support EKS, GKE, or on-prem Kubernetes clusters.

Governance & Compliance: The built-in audit logging feature makes it ideal for teams needing traceability in regulated environments.

Training & Enablement: New engineers can safely explore K8s operations with guardrails, making onboarding and upskilling faster.
